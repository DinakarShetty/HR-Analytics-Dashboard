## 🧮 DAX Measures (Key Metrics)

```DAX
Total Employees = COUNT(EmployeeData[EmployeeID])

Attrition Count = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(EmployeeData[EmployeeID]),
    EmployeeData[Attrition] = "Yes"
)

Active Employees = 
[Total Employees] - [Attrition Count]

Attrition Rate % =
DIVIDE([Attrition Count], [Total Employees]) * 100

Average Age = AVERAGE(EmployeeData[A]()
